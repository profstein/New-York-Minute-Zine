				<h5>This article is adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park"> this Wikipedia entry.</h5></a>

				<p>Central Park is an urban park in Manhattan, New York City. It is located between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side, roughly bounded by Fifth Avenue on the east, Central Park West (Eighth Avenue) on the west, Central Park South (59th
					Street) on the south, and Central Park North (110th Street) on the north. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with 40 million visitors in 2013, and one of the most filmed locations in the world. In terms of
					area, Central Park is the fifth-largest park in New York City, covering 843 acres (341 ha).</p>

				<p>The park was established in 1857 on 778 acres (315 ha) of land acquired by the city. In 1858, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and architect/landscape designer Calvert Vaux won a design competition to improve and expand the park
					with a plan they titled the &ldquo;Greensward Plan&rdquo;. Construction began the same year, and the park's first area was opened to the public in the winter of 1858. Construction north of the park continued during the American Civil War in
					the 1860s, and
					the park was expanded to its current size in 1873. After a period of decline in the early 20th century, Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the Central
					Park
					Conservancy in 1980, which refurbished many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

				<p>With recreational facilities abounding, the more energetic won’t have a problem finding a spot to skate, pedal, row, dribble, or climb to his or her heart’s delight. Although Central Park has 21 official playgrounds, we like to think of it
					as
					one gigantic jungle gym in its peak season.</p>

				<p>150 years’ worth of visitors have enjoyed and recommended Central Park; don’t you think it’s time for your turn?</p>
